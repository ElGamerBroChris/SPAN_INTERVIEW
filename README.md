# SPAN_INTERVIEW
SPAN Technical Challenge

## Program description
The rank calculator will receive a list of games, whether by a file or through console, and will print out the ranks for the league. This is following the following scoring system:
- A win awards 3 points for the ranking to the winning team.
- A tie awards 1 point to each team.
- A loss awards no points.

## Running the program
Preferably import into eclipse as a java project and run the MainClass. This will prompt for whether you want to use a file or input into the console each game.

In the case of console input, keep in mind that you have to type capital X and enter to exit. Once you exit, the results will be calculated.

In the case of file input, just send the file to be used. You can use TESTDATA.txt which is found in the root of the repository in case you want to test it.

Both alternatives have to follow the following structure for each entry of the list of games.
> **[TEAM1] [SCORE], [TEAM2] [SCORE]**
> Ex. Tarantulas 1, FC Awesome 0
